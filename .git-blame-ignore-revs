# Since version 2.23 (August 2019), git-blame has a feature
# to ignore or bypass certain commits.
#
# This file contains a list of commits that are not likely what you
# are looking for in a blame, such as mass reformatting or renaming.
#
# These settings only apply once you've run an install once.

# style: cleanup comments
